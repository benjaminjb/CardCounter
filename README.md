# CardCounter
===========

## Summary 
A simple iOS program for counting cards in blackjack, written to teach myself iOS programming and as a gift for my girlfriend.

## Tech Stack

1. XCode IDE
2. C#

## Instruction and assistance

This is my first iOS program, based loosely on the Matchismo card-matching game taught in the Stanford Online course in [iOS 7 programming](http://online.stanford.edu/course/developing-ios7-apps-fall-2013).

Special thanks also to [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/466/blackjack) for their episode on blackjack and card counting.

## Design

The app was built very simply, with two decks of standard cards; clicking on either deck will deal a random, non-repeating card. The app keeps track of how "hot" the deck is by counting cards under/over 10. 

## Pain points

As this was my first foray into iOS programming, it's hard to identify specific pain points. The Stanford class slides were especially helpful in figuring out how to program the various parts of the MVC design. But there wasn't too much information, at this level, on good UI/UX design.

Unfortunately, though I finished the program before my girlfriend went to Las Vegas, I couldn't deploy it to her iPad.
