CardCounter

Summary: Simple iOS program for counting cards in blackjack

This is my first iOS program, based loosely on the Matchismo card-matching game taught in the Stanford Online course in iOS 7 programming: http://online.stanford.edu/course/developing-ios7-apps-fall-2013.

The app was built very simply, with two decks of standard cards; clicking on either deck will deal a random, non-repeating card. The app keeps track of how "hot" the deck is by counting cards under/over 10.
